// When set to 1, EB_CPU_FLAGS_NEON is unconditionally set for all ARCH_AARCH64
// builds, i.e. requiring Neon for library to work. This also allows linker to
// strip code for all C functions which are optimized with Neon SIMD and thus
// reduce final binary size.
// Neon is mandatory in Armv8.0-A (AArch64), which is our minimum Arm target,
// so it is guaranteed for our builds.

// AVX2 was first released in 2013 on Haswell microarchitecture, all x86
// processors since support it.
// You can set it to 1 to reduce binary size if deployment platforms are
// guaranteed to be not older than Haswell.
